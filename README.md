# auto-plant-watering
ESP8266 and 3D Printing project for auto watering plants on my balcony.
My goal is to be able to water them when I'm not at home, or even better, auto water them when the soil is dry.

This is still a work-in-progress. I will progressively upload here my files and add a complete documentation when the project is finished.
